In your API repository, add a README.md file that explains your approach, key takeaways, and any challenges you encountered during the assignment. This will help your reviewers understand your work in detail.

    My approach to this homeowork was following along with the videos on the slides and searching up resources
for additional help when I got stuck on issues. My main takeaways from this was learning about the concepts 
behind databases and how to set up the backend API and integrate that into my existing frontend. Through this
assignment, my main challenge was working with TypeScript becuase I was used to using JavaScript,  but I was
able to gain more clarity on TS by searching and reseraching on Google.
